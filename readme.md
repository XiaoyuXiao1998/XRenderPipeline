# RenderEngine

## Introduction
This is my personal rendering playground to learn unity and various rendering techiques

## Finished parts
### TAA for static objects and cameras
1. WithOut TAA:
<img width = "600" height = "300" src = "https://github.com/XiaoyuXiao1998/XRenderPipeline/blob/main/demos/withoutTAA.png" alt="shadow pass"/>
2. With TAA:
<img width = "600" height = "300" src = "https://github.com/XiaoyuXiao1998/XRenderPipeline/blob/main/demos/withTAA.jpg" alt="PCF"/>

### cluster based deferred rendering
1.Yellow grids are clusters generated by camera, and red grids are clusters affected by the point light.
